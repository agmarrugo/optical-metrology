# Optical Metrology

### First semester 2016

Andrés Marrugo, PhD
*Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar*

##  Aims and Scope

This semester course is an introduction to optical metrology. It is aimed at graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. We will focus on the practical and theoretical aspects of techniques in optical metrology.

At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Have clear idea of challenges in metrology due to increasing trend towards miniaturisation.
- Understand many different metrological devices and principles and applicability of those devices.
- Understand the process and provide metrological solution for the improvement of a process.

## Outline

This is a new course, this website will be updated as we go along.

### Lecture 1: Introduction

We will be discussing the main aspects about metrology and why it is so important in manufacturing. 

[Lecture 1 slides](lectures/Lecture_01.pdf)

#### Optional Reading

- [Optical metrology overview](pdfs/01-optical-metrology-overview.pdf)

### Lecture 2: Random Data and Characterization of Measurement Systems

In this lecture we will be discussing about random data, their properties and measurement systems. We will also discuss static and dynamic characterization of measurement systems.

### Lecture 2: Cont'd

In this lecture we focus on practical aspects and calculations of characterization of measurement systems, calibration and uncertainty via confidence interval estimation.

For the calculations we will be using Python via Ipython (Jupyter) notebooks. Please [download the Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution that contains Python and many more scientific packages.
